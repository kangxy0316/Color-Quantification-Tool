# ColorQuant: A Comprehensive Color Analysis Platform with Advanced Distance Algorithms

**ColorQuant** is an integrated software platform designed for comprehensive color analysis. It allows users to perform multi-dimensional color analysis with advanced distance algorithms and professional visualization features. The software supports various color spaces (RGB, LAB, HSV), implements multiple distance metrics (including ΔE2000 and Bhattacharyya distance), and features dominant color extraction using K-means clustering.

ColorQuant is targeted at researchers and scientists who require quantitative color analysis but may lack programming expertise or access to expensive commercial software. The platform offers an intuitive graphical user interface and supports batch processing, making it accessible for both individual projects and large-scale studies.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Color Spaces**: Supports RGB, LAB, and HSV color spaces for comprehensive analysis.
- **Advanced Distance Metrics**: Includes ΔE2000, Bhattacharyya distance, Euclidean distances in both LAB and RGB spaces, and color diversity metrics using Shannon entropy.
- **Dominant Color Extraction**: Utilizes K-means clustering to extract dominant colors from images.
- **Batch Processing**: Allows for efficient analysis of multiple images simultaneously without requiring programming skills.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generates 3D color space plots, heatmaps of distance matrices, and color harmony analysis for enhanced data interpretation.
- **Flexible Export**: Results can be exported in multiple formats, including Excel, CSV, and JSON.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Material Design 3 principles for a modern, responsive, and easy-to-navigate graphical interface.
